The Reminder App



App

Aim: Develop an android app, which is basically a reminder app with an astonishing feature to remind you not only based on time but based on people around

The Android app detects the people around, and if a person sets a reminder, say for example, John has to ask Davis for his application, so whenever Davis comes within the bluetooth range of John, a notification pops up in John's phone saying Davis is around, ask him for the application. This app will help a lot of people in their day to day life, with real target on people working at offices.
